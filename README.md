### Description
3D vaporwave animation 

# itreldi

## About
Itereldi is a playground I used to create a 3D vaporwave animation for my [personal page](https://undefinedrabb.it) on [github](https://github.com/undefinedrabb-it/undefinedrabb.it).
You can sneak-peak the animation at https://undefinedrabb-it.github.io/itreldi/.

## Quick Start 

### Requirements
You only need the `nodejs` package. <br/>
Verified compatibility with node versions `16.x.y` and `20.x.y`.

### Usage
Install dependencies (I use pnpm but it is also possible to use `npm` or `yarn`):

```bash
pnpm i
```

Then run:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```
